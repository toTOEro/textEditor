  ## Description

  This profile generator generates a webpage to display my team's basic information in order to have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles. This program uses inquirer to query the user in the terminal for information regarding the team. Afterwards, that information is inserted directly into HTML code to eventually be output into an HTML file that presents the team.
